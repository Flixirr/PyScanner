# PyScanner

## Why this project?

I was looking for any project I could do in python, then I remembered that I had a lot of stuff related to cybersec on my PC so that's why I decided to make a port scanner since it was probably easiest thing to make for me.

## Used libs

* PyQt5 with QtDesigner
* Multi-threading
* Sockets
